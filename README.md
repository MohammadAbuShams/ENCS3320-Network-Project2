# ENCS3320 Computer Networks - Project2

## Overview
This project engages students in creating a fully functional network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It covers IP subnetting, server configuration, VLAN setup, routing protocols, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Project Objectives
- Master Packet Tracer tool.
- Understand and perform IP subnetting.
- Configure network services like HTTP, DNS, and email.
- Set up routing protocols and VLANs.
- Implement and understand ACLs.

## Topology Description
- **Devices Used**: Routers (2811), Switches (2950-24), Email/DNS/WEB Servers (Server-PT), PCs (PC-PT).
- **Sub-networks**: Data center, two company networks, a home network, and a core network with routers.

## Part-wise Requirements

### Part 0: IP Assignment and Subnetting
- Use a group member's student ID to determine the IP addressing scheme.

### Part 1: Building the Topology
- Construct the network topology in Packet Tracer.
- Configure devices and interfaces based on the assigned IPs and subnetting.
- Set static and dynamic IP configurations across the network.

### Part 2: Configuring Servers and VLANs
- Configure HTTP, DNS, and email servers with specific settings and domain names.
- Set up VLANs for different segments and configure DHCP for dynamic IP allocation.

### Part 3: Routing Protocols
- Implement RIPv2, OSPF, and protocol redistribution across multiple routers.

### Part 4: Testing Connectivity
- Perform and document connectivity tests using ping, tracert, and web access.
- Test email functionality across the network.

### Part 5: ACL Configuration
- Apply ACLs to restrict access based on specific project requirements.
